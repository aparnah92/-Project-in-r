Predective modelling in R
The dataset used for this code is added to the repository. 

Dataset: Vertebral column of orthopedic patients
This dataset makes use of biomechanical features such as pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, pelvic radius, lumbar lordosis angle, degree of spondylolisthesis and sacral slope of orthopedic patients to determine if the patient is diagnosed as normal or abnormal (having disk hernia or spondylolisthesis).

P: No. of Predictors = 6
N: No. of Observations = 310
