1) Predictive modelling in R
   The dataset used for this code is added to the repository.
   
   Dataset: Vertebral column of orthopedic patients
   This dataset makes use of biomechanical features such as pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, pelvic radius, lumbar lordosis angle, degree of    spondylolisthesis and sacral slope of orthopedic patients to determine if the patient is diagnosed as normal or abnormal (having disk      hernia or spondylolisthesis).

   P: No. of Predictors = 6
   N: No. of Observations = 310

2) Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks   

   The data consists of 800 retinal images. the images are obtained from the Messidor database. Image Analysis & Stereology, v. 33, n. 3,      p. 231-234, aug. 2014. ISSN 1854-5165.
